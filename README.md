Shit coded, dont look at the code.



Instructions:  
If running on single vps/windows   
	vps: python3 ./main.py  
	windows: start.bat  
If running on patrodactyle:  
	put server.py on panel and run it.  
	it will install modules if it finds missing ones  
	when it says "Created server instance, now listening for connections..."  
	the u r good to go and run the client.py on your local machine
